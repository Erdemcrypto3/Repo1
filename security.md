# security model
the security model of the project should be defined before the project starts. 
## extra security requiremetns
since there will be only 1 tenant within 1 environment, there sohuld be no tenant-wide security restrictions. but according to client requirements, some custom requirements can occur.
## development for extra security requirements
the development should be reviewed by the client solution architects to confirm the structure. when the handover happens, the client should have a structure they they had already approved.
